# --- General Text File Handling ---
# Treat all files as text by default, enabling line ending normalization.
# Git will automatically handle line endings based on core.autocrlf settings
# and apply LF in the repository.
* text=auto

# --- Specific Line Ending Enforcement ---
# For shell scripts, always ensure LF line endings in the repository and working tree.
# This is crucial for execution on Unix-like systems (WSL/Linux).
*.sh text eol=lf

# --- Binary Files ---
# Explicitly mark common binary file types to prevent Git from attempting
# line ending conversions or text diffs, which can cause corruption or
# noisy diffs.

# --- Large File Storage (Git LFS) ---
# Uncomment and configure these lines if you plan to use Git LFS for large files.
# Make sure Git LFS is installed and initialized (`git lfs install`).
# *.psd filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text # Photoshop files
# *.zip filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text # Large archives
# *.onnx filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text # ML model files
# *.h5 filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text   # Keras model files

# --- Special Diffs ---
# For Jupyter Notebooks, use the ipynb diff driver to show meaningful changes.
# You might need to set up the diff driver in your global Git config.
# git config --global diff.ipynb.textconv 'jupyter nbstripout'
# git config --global diff.ipynb.binary true
# *.ipynb diff=ipynb

# For CSV files, use a specific diff driver to improve readability of changes.
# You might need to configure a custom textconv filter in your global Git config.
# *.csv diff=csv
